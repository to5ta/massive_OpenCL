# Massive parallel Calculations using OpenCL

The `tasks` folder contains various projects that make use of OpenCL to do intense calculations such as calculating histograms or doing a [BitonicSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter).
In some cases the task was also implemented without OpenCL to compare performance GPU vs CPU.
